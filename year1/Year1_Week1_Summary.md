Author: Julián Rojas
Research Log — Cognitive Modeling & Personalized AI Systems


Overview

During this first week, the project progressed from foundational cognitive theory to a fully structured hybrid AI architecture integrating cognitive ontology, operationalized signals, Bayesian inference, and neural reasoning. The work developed across seven “year-equivalent” days, resulting in a theoretically grounded, scientifically testable, and computationally coherent framework.

Day 1 — Cognitive Foundations

Established the core theoretical base of the system:
	•	Defined four fundamental cognitive constructs: operationalization, cognitive ontology, Bayesian updating, and mental state modeling.
	•	Built a six-line hybrid modeling framework integrating probabilistic inference with neural language models.
	•	Developed an extended theoretical rationale linking cognitive science principles to AI personalization.

Outcome: A formal cognitive foundation guiding all subsequent computational design.


Day 2 — System Architecture

Constructed the full multi-layer architecture:
	•	Cognitive Construct Layer
	•	Signal Operationalization Engine
	•	Bayesian Mental State Inference Module
	•	Neural Reasoning Module
	•	Cognitive Control Integrator
	•	Personalization & Adaptation Layer

Mapped end-to-end system data flow and defined computational responsibilities for each layer.

Outcome: A clear, modular architecture connecting theory to computation.


Day 3 — Formal Representations & Specification

Defined:
	•	Construct ontologies in machine-readable formats
	•	Operationalization schemas
	•	Bayesian variable structures
	•	Integration functions for neural-probabilistic fusion

Outcome: A precise formal specification enabling implementation.

Day 4 — Empirical Validation Strategy

Developed a rigorous empirical plan including:
	•	Construct–signal alignment tests
	•	Inference stability analyses
	•	Neural–probabilistic integration benchmarks
	•	Adaptive behavior effectiveness metrics
	•	A low-cost real-world validation study design

Outcome: A scientific validation strategy aligned with contemporary computational cognitive science.


Day 5 — Reliability & Cognitive Validation Framework

Created:
	•	A Construct-Level Validation Framework
	•	Internal consistency and convergent/divergent reliability protocols
	•	Bayesian reliability analysis
	•	Cross-modal evidence integration procedures
	•	Simulation-based cognitive stress tests

Outcome: A comprehensive reliability and validation methodology.

Day 6 — Prototype Blueprint

Designed the blueprint for an early prototype, including:
	•	Core modules and their computational interfaces
	•	Sample pseudocode for inference flow
	•	Example construct definitions and operationalization tables
	•	Cognitive-action policies for the controller
	•	Integration guidelines for Bayesian and neural components

Outcome: A structured prototype-level design linking theory to engineered components.


Day 7 — Future Directions & Research Roadmap

Finalized a multi-month research roadmap including:
	•	Extension of construct libraries
	•	Development of hierarchical Bayesian inference
	•	Integration of uncertainty quantification
	•	Cross-dataset validation with cognitive tasks
	•	Preparation of a preprint-style document for formal dissemination

Outcome: A long-term development plan positioning the project within the broader field of cognitive computational modeling.


End of Week 1 Summary

The first seven days established a complete theoretical, architectural, validation, and prototype framework for a cognitively grounded, hybrid AI system. The work produced this week forms the scientific backbone of the entire project and provides a solid base for future empirical experiments, implementation, and academic communication.
