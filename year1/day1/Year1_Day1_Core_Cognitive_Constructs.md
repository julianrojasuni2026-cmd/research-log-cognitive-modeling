## **1. Four Core Cognitive Constructs**

### **1. Operationalization**  
The process by which an abstract mental construct (e.g., *working memory load*) is transformed into a measurable variable. This includes behavioral indicators, task performance, reaction times, error patterns, or neural signatures. Without operationalization, cognitive concepts cannot become computationally tractable.

### **2. Cognitive Ontology**  
The formal structure that defines and relates mental processes, as represented in *The Cognitive Atlas*. This ensures that the model reasons using precise, standardized scientific constructs rather than vague categories or heuristics.

### **3. Bayesian Updating**  
A probabilistic mechanism for continuously adjusting beliefs about the user’s cognitive state. As new behavioral or contextual evidence arrives, the model refines its estimates of goals, uncertainty, effort, or strategy. This allows *inference* rather than simple pattern recognition.

### **4. Mental State Modeling**  
The estimation of internal cognitive representations—intentions, strategies, cognitive load, and uncertainty—to enable true personalization. This goes beyond typical LLM personalization, which relies only on surface-level preferences.

## **2. Six-Line Mini-Framework — Hybrid Cognitive Modeling**

1. The system pulls formal cognitive constructs from the Cognitive Atlas.  
2. Each construct is operationalized into observable signals (actions, patterns, timing).  
3. A Bayesian module updates probabilities of the user’s cognitive state in real time.  
4. A neural language model interprets contextual and semantic information.  
5. Both systems coordinate through a *cognitive controller* module.  
6. The assistant adapts actions and responses based on inferred mental states.

## **3. Extended Theoretical Basis (Academic-Level Explanation)**

Current AI personalization models rely heavily on behavioral correlations, which limits their ability to infer underlying mental processes. Cognitive science, however, emphasizes the importance of well-defined constructs, standardized ontologies, and explicit modeling of mental states.

This architecture addresses those limitations through:

- **Formal cognitive ontologies** to maintain structural and definitional rigor.  
- **Explicit operationalization** that converts cognitive constructs into measurable computational variables.  
- **Real-time Bayesian inference** to model dynamic shifts in cognition.  
- **Neural generative models** to extract meaning-rich representations from natural language.  

The hybrid probabilistic–neural framework aligns closely with Poldrack’s vision for integrating cognitive structure into computational models and represents a novel pathway toward scientifically grounded personalized AI systems.
