Year 1 – Day 4

Empirical Validation Strategy for a Cognitive-Grounded AI System
Research Log — Cognitive Modeling & Personalized AI Systems
Author: Julián Rojas


1. Purpose of Day 4

Establish a professionally rigorous, academically credible strategy for empirically validating the hybrid model (cognitive constructs → signals → Bayesian inference → neural integration).
The goal is to demonstrate that the system is not only theoretically coherent, but measurable, testable, and scientifically verifiable.


2. Validation Pillar 1 — Construct–Signal Alignment Tests

This pillar evaluates whether the operationalized signals truly represent the defined cognitive constructs.
It includes:
	•	Construct–indicator concordance: correlation between Cognitive Atlas definitions and observed measures.
	•	Convergent validity: different signals should point to the same construct.
	•	Discriminant validity: signals should not “bleed into” unrelated constructs.

Expected outcome: empirical evidence that the theory → data bridge is correctly designed.


3. Validation Pillar 2 — Bayesian Inference Stability Analysis

Evaluates whether the Bayesian module produces stable and coherent estimates.
Techniques used:
	•	Sensitivity tests under noise.
	•	Comparison between informed priors vs. flat priors.
	•	Posterior convergence analysis.

Expected outcome: a robust probabilistic engine capable of modeling real cognitive variability.


4. Validation Pillar 3 — Neural–Probabilistic Integration Benchmark

Assesses the effectiveness of the integrator (CCI) in fusing LLM semantic signals with Bayesian cognitive states.
Evaluation methods:
	•	Coherence metrics between inferred state and generated output.
	•	“Construct alignment score”: how well responses respect formal constructs.
	•	A/B reasoning tests with vs. without cognitive integration.

Expected outcome: evidence that the hybrid architecture outperforms a standard LLM in cognitive personalization.


5. Validation Pillar 4 — Adaptive Behavior Effectiveness

Analyzes the impact of cognitively informed personalization on the user.
Proposed metrics:
	•	Adapted explanation clarity.
	•	Reduction in perceived cognitive load.
	•	Decision-making efficiency.
	•	Coherence between user strategy and adaptive recommendations.

Expected outcome: behavioral evidence demonstrating the practical value of the system.


6. Proposed Mini-Study for Real-World Validation

A quick, low-cost but academically valid study design:
	•	Participants: 10–20 users.
	•	Tasks: problem solving with adaptive difficulty.
	•	Measures: response times, decisions, strategy shifts, language.
	•	Comparison: cognitive system vs. non-cognitive system.

Key insight: even with a small sample, cognitive patterns and adaptive gains should be clearly detectable.


7. Academic Signal to Poldrack (Subtle, Professional, Clean)

This validation plan follows the lines of work emphasized by Poldrack on:
	•	rigorous operationalization,
	•	reproducibility,
	•	inferential stability, and
	•	construct-driven modeling.

It demonstrates that the model is not merely conceptual but scientifically verifiable — aligning with contemporary standards in computational cognitive science.
