1. Objective of Day 7

Define a rigorous, multi-layered benchmarking and evaluation blueprint that positions the hybrid cognitive–computational architecture within existing standards in cognitive science, machine learning, and computational modeling.
This establishes the foundation for future publications, cross-lab collaborations, and empirical comparisons.

2. Benchmarking Philosophy and Goals

The evaluation strategy is designed to assess:
	•	Alignment between cognitive constructs and system behavior
	•	Predictive value of the hybrid model vs. standard neural models
	•	Stability and reproducibility across tasks and contexts
	•	Construct-level interpretability in real time
	•	Contribution of each architectural layer (CCL, SOE, BMSIM, NRCIM, CCI, PAL)

This framework ensures the model is not merely functional, but scientifically accountable.

3. Benchmark Set 1 — Cognitive Construct Coherence Tests

A suite of tasks designed to evaluate whether the system’s internal states correspond to formal cognitive constructs.

Key metrics:
	•	Construct Coherence Index (CCI): similarity between inferred constructs and canonical cognitive models
	•	Ontology Alignment Score: parity with Cognitive Atlas relational structure
	•	Behavior–Construct Correlation: empirical associations between user behavior and internal representations

These tests examine whether the architecture maintains conceptual fidelity during inference.

4. Benchmark Set 2 — Bayesian State Inference Accuracy

Evaluates the reliability of the Bayesian Mental State Inference Module (BMSIM).

Methods include:
	•	Posterior predictive checks
	•	KL-divergence between predicted vs. observed cognitive indicators
	•	Stability under noisy, sparse, or conflicting evidence
	•	Hierarchical prior sensitivity analysis

Outputs validate the probabilistic engine’s ability to model uncertainty and latent cognition.

5. Benchmark Set 3 — Neural–Probabilistic Synergy Evaluation

Assesses the effectiveness of the Cognitive Control Integrator (CCI) in merging semantic and probabilistic information.

Metrics:
	•	Integration Gain Score: improvement in performance when fusion is active
	•	Semantic–Construct Consistency: alignment between language outputs and inferred cognitive states
	•	Response Policy Coherence: consistency between internal state transitions and action-generation policies

This evaluates whether the hybrid system surpasses standard LLM behavior.

6. Benchmark Set 4 — Adaptive Behavior Quality

Tests how well the system adapts to user cognition across tasks.

Evaluated by:
	•	Problem-solving efficiency
	•	Cognitive load modulation
	•	Explanation clarity under varying difficulty
	•	Strategy alignment with user patterns
	•	Real-time adaptation latency

These metrics connect cognitive theory to practical system performance.

7. Benchmark Set 5 — Simulation-Based Stress and Robustness Testing

Uses controlled simulations to test performance under extreme cognitive scenarios.

Stress conditions:
	•	Rapid shifts in user strategy
	•	High uncertainty or ambiguous inputs
	•	Contradictory multimodal signals
	•	Time-pressured interactions
	•	Simulated cognitive fatigue scenarios

Robust models should produce stable inference trajectories despite these perturbations.

8. Long-Term Evaluation Roadmap

A forward-looking outline for sustained empirical evaluation:
	•	Extension to multi-participant studies
	•	Parameter recovery experiments
	•	Integration with experimental tasks from cognitive psychology
	•	Comparison against alternative cognitive-modeling frameworks
	•	Development of construct-level benchmarks for hybrid AI systems
	•	Building a reproducible evaluation dataset

This roadmap situates the project within ongoing computational-cognitive research efforts.
