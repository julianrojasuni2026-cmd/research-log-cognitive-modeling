1. Objective of Day 1

Develop a rigorous pipeline for extracting latent cognitive features from multimodal user data (behavioral, linguistic, temporal). The goal is to transform raw interaction signals into structured, interpretable indicators aligned with formal cognitive constructs.


2. Multimodal Feature Engineering Framework (MFEF)

The feature engineering process is divided into four complementary layers:

2.1 Behavioral Interaction Features

Derived from user actions during problem-solving or dialog interactions:
	•	Response latency distributions
	•	Action–decision transitions
	•	Strategy-shift markers
	•	Error-correction signatures

These features capture micro-patterns associated with cognitive control, uncertainty, and load.

2.2 Linguistic-Cognitive Features

Extracted from natural-language outputs via LLM-based semantic parsing:
	•	Hedging indicators
	•	Explicit uncertainty statements
	•	Goal orientation cues
	•	Cognitive-strategy descriptors

Each linguistic signal is mapped to a construct through an ontology-informed schema.


2.3 Temporal Dynamics Features

Focus on how cognitive states evolve over time:
	•	Drift patterns
	•	Stability/volatility windows
	•	Sudden transitions in behavior
	•	Cognitive momentum metrics

Temporal dynamics provide the foundation for longitudinal mental-state inference.


2.4 Cross-Modal Feature Alignment

Combined integration of all signal types:
	•	Normalization and scaling of heterogeneous indicators
	•	Cross-modal correlation analysis
	•	Construct-specific weighting matrices
	•	Noise-resilience filtering

The result is a unified feature vector grounded in formal cognitive theory.


3. Latent Construct Extraction Pipeline (LCEP)

A structured mechanism for deriving hidden cognitive variables from observable features.

Step 1 — Feature–Construct Mapping

Each engineered feature is linked to:
	•	A Cognitive Atlas construct
	•	A corresponding operationalization definition
	•	A formal indicator class (behavioral, linguistic, temporal)

Step 2 — Dimensionality Reduction

Techniques:
	•	Probabilistic PCA
	•	Sparse factor modeling
	•	Variational embeddings aligned with construct definitions

This produces interpretable latent spaces instead of opaque embeddings.

Step 3 — Construct-Consistent Refinement

Latent dimensions are adjusted to:
	•	Maximize alignment with theoretical definitions
	•	Minimize cross-construct contamination
	•	Preserve interpretability for downstream Bayesian inference

Step 4 — Output Specification

Produces:
	•	A construct-aligned latent vector
	•	Confidence intervals for each estimated latent variable
	•	Metadata for reproducibility and validation

4. Scientific Rationale

This framework enables:
	•	High-resolution modeling of cognitive states
	•	Transparent links between raw data and theoretical constructs
	•	A rigorous foundation for Bayesian inference and adaptive reasoning
	•	Reproducible construct extraction aligned with cognitive science standards
